    <h2>Pairing Process</h2>
    <p>
        BLE pairing occurs in three phases, where the Central and Peripheral exchange information and keys to establish
        a secure connection. These phases include the exchange of pairing features, key generation, and specific key
        distribution.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="bubble">
    <h3>Phase 1 - Pairing Feature Exchange</h3>
    <p>
        During this phase, the Central and Peripheral devices exchange information to determine the key generation
        method for the second phase. This exchange is done through a pairing request and response, with the parameters
        included in these packets. The key generation method is selected as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, the Authentication Requirement Secure Connection (SC) Flag is checked. If both devices have this flag
        set, the pairing mechanism used is LE Secure Connection. If one or both devices do not have this flag set, the
        pairing mechanism used is LE Legacy. This is later needed to see if OOB data is used or which key generation
        method is selected based on the IO Capabilities.

        Next, the Out of Band (OOB) flag is checked. In LE Legacy pairing, if both devices have Out of Band
        authentication data, the Authentication Requirements Flags are ignored, and the Out of Band pairing method is
        used. In LE Secure Connections pairing, if one or both devices have out of band authentication data, the
        Authentication Requirements Flags are ignored, and the Out of Band pairing method is used. If neither of these
        conditions is met, the pairing method is determined based on the MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) flag. If both devices
        do not have the MITM option set in the Authentication Requirements Flags, the IO capabilities are ignored, and
        the Just Works method is used. If at least one of the devices has the MITM flag set, the pairing method is
        selected according to the IO capabilities.

        The generated key will either be an Authenticated or Unauthenticated key. If the out of band authentication
        method is used and the Out of Band mechanism is known to be secure from eavesdropping the key is assumed to be
        authenticated. The exact strength depends upon the method used to transfer the out of band information. If the
        key generation method does not result in a key that provides sufficient security properties then the device must
        send the Pairing Failed command with the error code “Authentication Requirements”. This situation can occur, for
        example, if one device has the MITM flag set but the Just Works method was selected as the key generation
        method.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Just Works:</strong> In this method, no interaction is required from the user's side, except for
        initiating the pairing process. The devices will automatically establish an encrypted but not authenticated
        connection without any further input from the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Passkey Entry:</strong> With this method, the user is required to enter a specific passkey during the
        pairing process. The passkey must be accurately inputed on the device equipped with a keyboard, and it will be
        displayed on the device that has a display. This ensures that the correct passkey is entered, thereby
        establishing an authenticated and encrypted connection between the devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Numeric Comparison:</strong> In this method, the user is prompted to compare the passkey displayed on
        both devices. By examining the passkeys and verifying that they match, the user can press the "Yes" button to
        confirm that the passkeys are indeed the same. This step establishes an authenticated and encrypted connection
        between the devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Out of Band:</strong> With this method, the user obtains the pairing key from an external source. This
        can be accomplished through various means, such as Near Field Communication (NFC) or scanning a QR Code. By
        acquiring the pairing key from an alternative source, the user can establish a secure connection between the
        devices, ensuring a reliable and efficient pairing process.

    <h3>Phase 2 - Short or Long Term Key Generation</h3>

    <h4>LE Legacy</h4>
    <p>
        In Legacy pairing, the devices use the key generation method to create a temporary key. For just works, the TK
        is set to 0, for passkey entry, the TK is created from the entered passkey. For example, if the user entered
        passkey is '019655' then TK shall be 0x00000000000000000000000000004CC7. For OOB, the TK can be any 128-bit key.
        Both devices then generate a random number and a confirm value (Mconfirm) using the TK and other parameters as
        input. They exchange the numbers and re-do the calculations. If the calculated confirm values do not match, the
        pairing process is aborted. If they do match, the initiating device calculates Short-term key (STK) and enables
        encryption.

        generate their own ECDH key pairs. These pairs consist of a private key and a public key. The public keys are
        then exchanged between devices during pairing. After exchanging public keys, the devices generate nonces and
        commitments to valudate the public keys.

                For Just Works and Numeric Comparison each device selects a random 128-bit nonce. The responding device
                then computes a confirmation value with a AES-CMAC function, which takes both public keys, the random
                nonce and 0 as input. The devices exchange their nonce values and the initiating device confirms the
                value. If there is a failure at this point, the protocol aborts. When using Just Works, commitment
                checks are not performed and the user is not shown the 6-digit values. When using Numeric Comparison,
                the devices compute 6-digit confirmation values that are displayed to the user. The user checks if these
                values match and confirms accordingly. If there is no match, the protocol aborts and new nonces must be

                For Passkey Entry the user enters the same Passkey into both devices. Alternatively, the Passkey can be

                function, which takes both public keys, the random nonce and one bit of the passkey as input. They
                exchange the random nonce and the confirmation value and redo the calculation to validate the value.
                This is then repeated for every bit of the passkey. They can then validate they passkey after confirming
