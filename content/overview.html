    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The SIG Bluetooth standard can quickly become overwhelming, especially when confronted with the extensive
        2800-page Bluetooth Core Specification. Navigating through the diverse Bluetooth standards, such as BR/EDR and
        BLE, along with the various protocols, connection types, and connection establishment algorithms, can indeed be
        daunting.
    </p>

    <h3>Bluetooth Technologies</h3>
    <p>There are two primary Bluetooth technologies, each known by different names, adding to the confusion:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR):</strong> This technology is more familiar to end-users, enabling
            peer-to-peer connections and higher bandwidth data transfers. It operates with a strict set of profiles and
            use cases.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Bluetooth Smart:</strong> BLE is designed for low energy consumption
            and custom applications. It supports various connection types including peer-to-peer, 1-to-many, and mesh.
            BLE is versatile, allowing for custom profiles and use cases.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Actors</h3>
    <p>
        Understanding the roles in BLE can be confusing due to similar or interchangeable terminology. Here's a
        breakdown of the different roles:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Master/Central:</strong> These devices scan and initiate connections, typically being a user's
            smartphone.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Client:</strong> These are usually the Master/Central devices that access information over the GATT
            protocol of an established BLE connection.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Slave/Peripheral:</strong> These devices advertise themselves and wait for a connection, often being
            custom IoT devices.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Server:</strong> Usually the Slave/Peripheral, these devices collect data and provide resources
            according to their specific use case.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For practical purposes, remember: <br />
        <strong>Master = Central = Client</strong><br />
        <strong>Slave = Peripheral = Server. </strong><br />
        In this guide, we will refer to them as Central and Peripheral.
    </p>

    <h3>Connection States</h3>
    <p>A Central and Peripheral can be in various states:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Non-Connected:</strong> The Central and Peripheral do not have an established connection and cannot
            communicate. In this state, there are also sub-states like avertising, scanning, initiating and standby.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Connected:</strong> This state represents the initial stage of establishing a wireless communication
            link between two BLE devices. The Central discovers and initiates a connection request to the Peripheral.
            During this process, they coordinate connection intervals and set up communication channels. This connection
            is BLE specific and unencrypted.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Paired:</strong> Pairing establishes a trusted relationship between the devices, involving an
            exchange of capabilities and security keys. Various methods, such as Just Works, Passkey Entry, or Out of
            Band (OOB), authenticate the devices to each other, agreeing upon security levels for the connection.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bonded:</strong> Bonding is a more advanced step than pairing, where security keys are stored for
            future reconnections. Once bonded, devices can automatically reconnect securely without repeating the
            pairing process, saving time and enhancing convenience for regular connections.
        </li>
    </ul>
