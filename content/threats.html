    <h2>Attacks</h2>
    <h3>Identity Tracking</h3>
    <p>
        Identity tracking refers to the method of monitoring a user's movements and activities based on their Bluetooth
        Low Energy (BLE) connections. This tracking is feasible because BLE packets can be identified by their device
        addresses. Tracking becomes particularly easy when public addresses (which are globally unique and registered)
        or long-term random addresses are used. These addresses can act as unique identifiers, allowing for the
        continuous monitoring of a device.
    </p>

    <h4>Mitigation</h4>
    <p>
        To counteract identity tracking, BLE employs the concept of resolvable and non-resolvable private addresses for
        its random device types. Resolvable private addresses offer a significant layer of protection against tracking.
        In this approach, both devices involved in the connection exchange an Identity Resolving Key (IRK). This key is
        used to frequently generate new private addresses, making each connection appear as if it's with a different
        device. This frequent change of address disrupts the continuity needed for effective tracking. On the other
        hand, non-resolvable private addresses, though less common, can be particularly useful in certain applications,
        such as beacons, where persistent identity is not critical. It's advisable to avoid using Public Device
        Addresses, as they can be easily tracked due to their unique and constant nature.

    <h3>Passive eavesdropping</h3>
    <p>
        Passive eavesdropping, also known as Sniffing, is a technique where an attacker covertly listens to the
        communication between two Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. In this context, the attacker passively observes
        the data exchange without actively injecting malicious content. Sniffing is viable in BLE communications when
        the devices are connected but not paired, or if the attacker has access to the Short Term Key (STK) in a LE
        Legacy connection, or the Long Term Key (LTK) in an LE Secure Connection.
    </p>

    <h4>Injection</h4>
    <p>
        Injection attacks become feasible when a connection is compromised through sniffing. If the attacker acquires
        the necessary keys in a paired connection, they can send forged packets to the devices, imitating legitimate
        data transmissions. This technique is distinct from a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, where the attacker
        actively relays and potentially alters the communication between two devices. Tools such as
        <a href="https://github.com/virtualabs/btlejack" target="_blank">btlejack</a>
        and

            >InjectaBLE</a
        >
        facilitate injection attacks on poorly secured BLE connections.
    </p>

    <h4>Possible Cases</h4>
    <h5>BLE Connection</h5>
    <p>
        Inherently, BLE connections are not encrypted, making them susceptible to eavesdropping. If an attacker is
        present at the initiation of a connection and captures the CONNECT_IND (Connection Indication), they can
        potentially monitor the entire communication process and intercept all packets transmitted between the devices.
        Conversely, intercepting existing connections is more challenging if the attacker was not present initially.
        They must track the connections by their access addresses and recover additional radio frequency parameters,
        such as Channel Map, timeouts, hops, windows, etc.
    </p>

    <h5>LE Legacy</h5>
    <p>
        For an LE Legacy paired connection, the attacker needs the Short Term Key (STK) to eavesdrop. During the pairing
        process, if the attacker is present, they can calculate the STK. For example, in the 'Just Works' pairing
        method, the Temporary Key (TK) is set to 0x00, enabling the attacker to compute the STK using all relevant
        parameters. In the 'Passkey Entry' method, the attacker must intercept the initial communication packets and can
        then attempt to brute-force the TK (which has 999999 possible combinations). Essential packets for this process
        include the two random values, LL_ENC_REQ, LL_ENC_RSP, and LL_START_ENC_REQ. In contrast, the Out of Band (OOB)
        method presents more difficulty since the TK could be any 128-bit value, rendering brute-force attacks
        impractical.
    </p>

    <h5>LE Secure Connection</h5>
    <p>
        LE Secure Connections employ Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) public key cryptography, significantly
        enhancing protection against sniffing attacks.
    </p>

    <h4>Mitigation</h4>
    <p>
        To defend against passive eavesdropping, it is recommended to use at least an LE Secure Connection pairing
        method or LE Legacy with OOB data. When utilizing OOB data, ensure that the transfer medium (like NFC, which
        benefits from close proximity) is also secure. Unpaired regular BLE connections should not be used for
        transmitting sensitive information due to their inherent security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <h3>Man-in-the-middle (MITM)</h3>
    <p>
        A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and manipulates communication between two
        parties. In this type of attack, the attacker establishes separate connections with each party, relaying and
        possibly altering the communications between them. The parties involved believe they have a secure direct
        connection, but in reality, they are both communicating through the attacker. This interception is critical for
        the attack, as without it, the two original devices would not be able to communicate. Additionally, MITM attacks
        can involve hijacking an existing connection using a LL_CONNECTION_UPDATE_IND packet. Tools such as
        <a href="https://homepages.laas.fr/rcayre/mirage-documentation/injectable.html?highlight=mitm" target="_blank"
            >InjectaBLE</a
        >
        offer experimental implementations of such attacks.
    </p>

    <h4>Mitigation</h4>
    <p>
        To secure your Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connections from MITM attacks, it's recommended to use at least the LE
        Secure Connection pairing method. This method can involve Numeric Comparison or Passkey Entry. Another option is
        to use Out-of-Band (OOB) data for establishing connections. When employing OOB data, ensure that the medium used
        for transferring this data is secure. For instance, Near Field Communication (NFC) is considered secure due to
        its requirement for close physical proximity. It's important to avoid using standard BLE connections without
        secure pairing when handling sensitive data.
