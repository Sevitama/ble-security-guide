    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        In Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), secure connections are established via pairing. This process allows Central and
        Peripheral devices to form authenticated and/or encrypted connections, facilitating the exchange of sensitive
        data while maintaining confidentiality and integrity. It aims to minimize the risk of eavesdropping or active
        interference by malicious entities. BLE also combats privacy and identity tracking through the use of random BLE
        addressing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Security Manager in BLE oversees this entire process, managing the pairing sequence and handling BLE random
        address resolution. It defines the necessary communication protocols and functions for key generation and
        exchange. The Security Manager Protocol (SMP) is employed to create encryption and identity keys. This protocol
        operates over a specific fixed L2CAP channel. Additionally, the Security Manager is tasked with storing these
        keys, generating random addresses, and resolving these addresses back to known device identities.
    </p>

    <h3>Security Modes and Levels</h3>
    <p>
        BLE provides two security modes: Security mode 1, with four levels, and security mode 2, with two levels. These
        definitions clarify the connection type between devices. Achieving specific Security Modes is done with pairing
        and involves setting certain parameters during the pairing process.
    </p>

    <h4>Security Mode 1</h4>
    Security Mode 1 focuses on authentication and encryption, defining the state of the connection:
    <ol>
        <li>No authentication and no encryption. This is a standard BLE connection.</li>
        <li>Unauthenticated pairing with encryption.</li>
        <li>Authenticated pairing with encryption.</li>
        <li>Authenticated LE Secure Connection with encryption.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Security Mode 2</h4>
    <p>
        Security Mode 2 is utilized for data signing, which transfers authenticated data between devices over an
        unencrypted connection. This method is favored by services requiring quick connection setups and rapid data
        transfers.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Unauthenticated pairing with data signing</li>
        <li>Authenticated pairing with data signing</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="bubble">
    <h3>Pairing</h3>
    <p>
        Pairing is necessary for authentication and/or encryption between a Central and Peripheral device. It is
        facilitated by the Security Manager (SM) using the Security Manager Protocol (SMP). Pairing occurs when the
        Central device initiates a pairing request or is compelled to pair when attempting to read/write an
        authenticated GATT characteristic. Note that pairing is optional, and regular BLE connections are
        unauthenticated and unencrypted.
    </p>

    <h4>Mechanisms</h4>
    <h5>LE Legacy</h5>
    <p>
        In LE Legacy pairing, devices exchange a Trusted Key and calculate a short-term key for encrypting the
        connection. If bonding is requested, a Long Term Key (LTK) is also generated and stored for future connections.
    </p>
    <h5>LE Secure Connection</h5>
    <p>
        LE Secure Connection improves security using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) for key generation, ensuring
        keys are independently generated by each device without transmission over the air, reducing interception risk.
        It also employs Numeric Comparison for enhanced protection against man-in-the-middle attacks, not available in
        Legacy Pairing. The heightened security of LE Secure Connections is ideal for applications demanding stringent
        data privacy and integrity.
    </p>

    <h4>Enforce pairing</h4>
    It is possible to enforce pairing. This is done with setting permissions on attributes in the Attribute Protocol. An
    attribute has a set of permission values associated with it. The permissions associated with an attribute specifies
    that it may be read and/or written. The permissions associated with the attribute specifies the security level
    required for read and/or write access, as well as notification and/or indication. The permissions of a given
    attribute are defined by a higher layer specification, and are not discoverable using the attribute protocol. If
    access to a secure attribute requires an authenticated link, and the client is not already authenticated with the
    server with sufficient security, then an error response shall be sent with the error code «Insufficient
    Authentication». When a client receives this error code it may try to authenticate the link, and if the
    authentication is successful, it can then access the secure attribute. If access to a secure attribute requires an
    encrypted link, and the link is not encrypted, then an error response shall be sent with the error code
    «Insufficient Encryption». When a client receives this error code it may try to encrypt the link and if the
    encryption is successful, it can then access the secure attribute.

    <h5>Atribute permissions</h5>
    The following access permissions are possible: • Readable • Writeable • Readable and writable The following
    encryption permissions are possible: • Encryption required • No encryption required The following authentication
    permissions are possible: • Authentication Required • No Authentication Required The following authorization
    permissions are possible: • Authorization Required • No Authorization Required Encryption, authentication, and
    authorization permissions can have different possibilities; for example, a specific attribute could require a
    particular kind of authentication or a certain minimum encryption key length. An attribute can have several
    combinations of permissions that apply; for example, a specific attribute could allow any of the following: • Read
    if encrypted (authentication not required) Write if authenticated and encrypted • Read or write if authenticated and
    authorized (irrespective of encryption)

                consists of a few flags which set the request specific features for a connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Bonding Flag:</strong> The bonding flag can be set if the initiating device wants to bond. When
                bonding is requested from both devices, the devices will exchange additional keys for future connections
                in phase 3 of the connection establishment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>MITM Flag:</strong> The Man-in-the-middle flag can be set, if the requesting device wants to
                have Man-in-the-middle protection. If MITM protection is requested, key generation methods which are
                vulnerable to MITM attacks can't be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>SC Flag:</strong> The Secure Connection flag can be set if the device supports the LE Secure
                Connection pairing mechanism. That means if the device can generate ECDH keys. If both devices have this
                set to 1, LE Secure Connection is used, else LE Legacy pairing is used.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Keypress Flag:</strong> The keypress field is used only in the Passkey Entry key generation
                method and is ignored in others. When both sides set that field to one, Keypress notifications shall be
                generated and sent using SMP Pairing Keypress Notification PDUs. The keypress notification is used by a
                device with KeyboardOnly IO capabilities to inform the remote device when keys have been entered or
                erased.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>CT2 Flag:</strong> The CT2 field can be set to 1 to indicate support for the h7 function.
                Normally it would use the h6 functions. These functions are used to convert keys of a given size from
                one key type to another key type with equivalent strength.
