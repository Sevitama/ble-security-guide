    <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
    <p>
        The Bluetooth standard, as outlined by the SIG, provides a detailed specification for a protocol. This
        specification includes the theoretical framework and implementation guidelines. The actual implementation of the
        Bluetooth standard is carried out by private manufacturers or open-source communities within their respective
        operating systems and SDKs. It's important to note that each implementation may vary, with its own unique
        quirks, functions, and interfaces.

    <h3>Android and iOS</h3>
    <p>
        Both Android and iOS have a comprehensive Bluetooth stack implementation that is accessible via settings or an
        internal API for apps, supporting BR/EDR and BLE right out of the box. Users can connect, pair, and bond with
        peripherals. Often the users do not notice any difference between pairing and bonding due to the security
        processes being entirely managed by the operating system, as developers have no control over the pairing
        parameters. When apps are developed to function as clients connecting to peripherals, they can establish
        connections to BLE devices using the APIs provided by iOS and Android, which by default are unencrypted
        connections. For improved security, pairing the device is necessary, which the operating system automatically
        initiates when an app tries to access a characteristic with elevated permissions. The peripheral responds with
        an 'Insufficient Authentication' message, prompting the OS to start the pairing and bonding process.
    </p>
    <p>
        iOS developers are unable to initiate pairing programmatically; it can only be done by interacting with
        authenticated characteristics. Additionally, iOS does not support initiating connections with Out-of-Band (OOB)
        data like NFC, and it will not initiate a pairing sequence upon reading an NFC tag with OOB data. In contrast,
        Android developers have the capability to initiate pairing and bonding using the createBond() function. Android
        also supports the use of OOB data, including NFC, for initiating connections.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the operating system-initiated pairing process with the peripheral, the request always includes following
        parameters designed to ensure the highest possible security level for BLE connections:

    <h3>Custom OS</h3>
    <p>
        In custom operating systems and implementations, especially in embedded systems that often act as peripherals or
        servers, the responsibility for configuration lies entirely with the developers. They have the freedom to define
        their own parameters for pairing, decide on address types to use, manage Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connections,
        and choose which data should be unencrypted, authenticated, and/or encrypted.
    </p>
    <p>
        This area offers a great opportunity to enhance security. Developers can make use of Software Development Kits
        (SDKs) and Hardware Abstraction Layers provided by manufacturers. These tools and built-in features allow
        developers to create customized applications that meet their specific needs. It's really important for
        developers to ensure that they configure the appropriate parameters to support the correct Security Mode and
        Level. While creating a custom Bluetooth stack may be tempting, it's generally not advised unless one has deep
        expertise in the area.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand should you not blindly trust the SDKs provided by manufacturers. Unfortunately, these SDKs can
        sometimes have vulnerabilities due to human errors in the libraries or non-compliance with Bluetooth standards.
        A good example is the
        <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/disclosures/sweyntooth/" target="_blank">Sweyntooth vulnerability set</a
        >, which was released around 2020 and consisted of 17 vulnerabilities in BLE implementations across various
        manufacturers. So, it's absolutely vital for developers to thoroughly verify that the SDK aligns with their
        security goals. You need to make sure that it sets the right parameters, accurately enforces characteristic
        permissions, and uses proper encryption methods, among other things.

    <h3>Web Bluetooth API</h3>
    <p>
        The Web Bluetooth API enables websites to communicate with nearby Bluetooth devices through the device's
        hardware Bluetooth controller, using JavaScript to connect and interact with BLE devices. This technology
        primarily functions as a Client/Central device and is supported by various browsers such as Chrome, Opera, and
        Edge, working across different hardware (PC, Mac, iPhone, etc.), Currently (End of 2023) it is still required to
        enable experimental web platform features in said browsers. The primary advantage of the Web Bluetooth API is
        its capacity to allow web developers to create applications that can interact directly with Bluetooth devices.
        This opens up a range of possibilities for IoT and other applications, facilitating out-of-the-box functionality
        like progressive web apps, irrespective of the operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an experimental feature, the Web Bluetooth API doesn't yet provide full functionality comparable to custom
        hardware or native iOS/Android apps. However, connecting to devices is relatively straightforward, allowing
        control over which devices should be visible during scanning and which connections are permitted. From a
        security perspective, it is similar to other devices; connections initiated via the webpage are unencrypted. For
        secure communication, pairing the Central device with the Peripheral is necessary, either through the operating
        system's Bluetooth settings or by enforcing permissions on characteristics. When the Web Bluetooth API wants to
        read or write characteristics that require elevated permissions, it automatically initiates pairing through the
        operating system. The operating system will utilize request parameters as typically defined for iOS/Android,
        while the response parameters depend on the Peripheral's implementation.
