    <strong>Pairing mechanism - LE Legacy Pairing:</strong> The pairing mechanism employed will be LE Legacy. This is
    due to either one or both devices not activating the SC Flag under Authentication Requirements within the pairing
    request or response packet. LE Legacy offers no protection against passive eavesdropping and minimal protection
    against Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks. Its security is only notably more enhanced when Out-of-Band (OOB) data is
    utilized. For better security, consider enabling the SC Flag on your custom device if possible to use LE Secure
    Connections.
