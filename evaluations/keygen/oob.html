    <strong>Key generation method - Out-of-band (OOB):</strong> The selected key generation method is 'Out-of-Band'

    The usability of this method is highly contingent on the medium selected, and it can also provide a robust level of
    security. The security effectiveness of the OOB method is directly related to the security of the chosen out-of-band
    medium.
