    <strong>Key generation method - Just Works:</strong> The selected key generation method is 'Just Works,' which is
    determined based on the IO Capabilities of the devices involved. 'Just Works' is the default choice when one or both
    devices lack the input capabilities necessary for confirming or entering a Passkey. With this method, no user input
    is required, significantly enhancing usability; however, it is less secure.

    This method of key generation should only be employed when there are no other alternatives available or when the
    data being transferred does not require confidentiality or integrity.
