    <strong>Key generation method - Numeric Comparison:</strong> The chosen key generation method is 'Numeric
    Comparison', exclusively available for LE Secure Connections. Users are prompted to view a Passkey on their device,
    which they must then verify against the Passkey displayed on the other device to ensure they match and confirm the
    absence of any Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.

    This method offers a heightened level of security by leveraging number comparison to counteract MITM attacks,
    coupled with the use of public keys during the key exchange process.
