    <strong>Key generation method - Passkey Entry:</strong> The selected key generation method is 'Passkey Entry'. With
    this method, users are required to manually enter a Passkey that is displayed on one device into the other device.
    In LE Legacy connections, this Passkey facilitates the exchange of a Short-Term Key. However, as the Passkey
    typically consists of only six digits, it is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. In the context of LE Secure
    Connections, the Passkey is utilized to authenticate the other device, followed by the exchange of a Long-Term Key
    through a public key exchange mechanism.
