<p>
    <strong>This pairing will be aborted!</strong> This request will be terminated with a "pairing failed" message,
    citing 'Authentication Requirements' as the reason. This occurs when at least one device has activated the MITM
    (Man-In-The-Middle) Flag within the Authentication Requirements, and the chosen key generation method is 'Just
    Works' (based on the IO Capabilities). This termination is independent of the pairing mechanism selected, whether it
    is LE Legacy or LE Secure Connection.
