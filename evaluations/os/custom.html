    <strong>Operating System - Custom:</strong> For tailored operating systems, it is crucial to ensure that the SDKs
    function as intended. Verify the pairing requests and responses with a BLE sniffer to confirm that all parameters
    are accurately configured. Additionally, ensure that the SDKs appropriately terminate connections when necessary
    (e.g., Just Works pairing should be terminated with the MITM flag set). Encrypt the connection between devices for
    enhanced security. If feasible, consider using Out-of-Band (OOB) data to achieve a superior level of security and
    usability.
