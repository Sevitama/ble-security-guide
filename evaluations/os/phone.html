    <strong>Operating System - iOS and Android:</strong> The initiating operating system will be an Android or iOS
    device. For these operation systems, make sure that an BLE connection is encrypted before sensitive data is
    transmitted. The recommended way is to make an BLE characteristic require authentication for reading or writing. The
    operating system of the phone ten will handle the pairing.
