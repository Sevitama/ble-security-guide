    <strong>Operating System - Web Bluetooth API:</strong> Web Bluetooth is rather new and often has to be activated
    first in the browser settings. For these connections, make sure to use a authenticated BLE characteristic and read
    that characteristic when connecting to a BLE device. The Browser will then prompt the operating system to initiate
    pairing with the BLE device.
