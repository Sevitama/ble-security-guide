    <strong>Threat - Passive eavesdropping:</strong> The connection is susceptible to passive eavesdropping attacks.
    This is because an attacker can brute force the keys when present during the pairing sequence. To enhance
    confidentiality, it is advised to upgrade to LE Secure Connections or utilize Out-of-Band (OOB) data for key
    exchange.

    This connection may also be vulnerable to identity tracking. Ensure the utilization of random and rotating BLE
    addresses and facilitate the exchange of an Identity Key during phase 3 of the pairing process.
