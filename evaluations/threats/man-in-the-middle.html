    <strong>Threat - Man-in-the-Middle:</strong> The connection is at risk of Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. This is
    because LE Legacy pairing with Just Works sets the Temporary key to 0, which then is used to calculate the
    Short-term-key. To bolster both confidentiality and integrity, it is advised to upgrade to LE Secure Connections or
    employ Out-of-Band (OOB) data for secure key exchange.

    This connection may also be vulnerable to identity tracking. Ensure the utilization of random and rotating BLE
    addresses and facilitate the exchange of an Identity Key during phase 3 of the pairing process.
